# login-system
The Project has a Java Spring backend and a React frontent. </br>
Because it is a example application the users are hardcoded.

username: user </br>
password: user1 </br>

The Protected Routing is working fine, but for the future it would be better to store the logged_in state in a cookie to access it if the ``/private`` route is beeing accessed and then check if the user is authenticated. 

It is a example app, the purpose is to create basic login so more complex apps should be better planned.
